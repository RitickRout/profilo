        <p>Algorithm is considered a method that is  used by computers for a solution of a problem. As there are a finite set of instruction that if followed it will lead to a accomplishement of a particular task.
            <div> It is composed of finite set of steps which may require one or more operations and it should satisfy some criteria </div>
            <p> critera 1 and 2 is that it should produce output to which external input may or moy not be given and according to criteria 3 each operation must be definite. criteria 4 is that it should terminate at a resonable short interval of time .
                <div>Note: we must be very conserned with analizing the efficient of our Algorithms</div>
                criteria 5 is that the algorithm each operation be effective as it could be exicuted by a person with pen and papper with a finite amount of time .
